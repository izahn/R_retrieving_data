============================================================

Web Scraping and Web APIs
---------------------------------------------------------

Data is more plentiful and in many ways easier to acquire than ever.
That doesn't always mean a perfectly cleaned and organized data set is
waiting for you to download it! More commonly data needs to be
retrieved from a web service or web page and assembled into a usable
data set. This workshop will show you how to do that, using the httr
and rvest packages in R.

Prerequisites and Preparation
-----------------------------

Prior to the workshop you should:

- install R from <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
- install the the `httr` and `rvest` and `jsonlite` packages in R with 
  `install.packages(c("httr", "rvest", "jsonlite"))`

If you wish to follow along and try things yourself you should have a laptop 
with the above software installed and a working internet connection.

You can view lesson notes at
