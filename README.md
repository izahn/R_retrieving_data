Web Scraping and Web APIs
---------------------------------------------------------
#### Ista Zahn

Workshop description
--------------------

Data is more plentiful and in many ways easier to acquire than ever.
That doesn't always mean a perfectly cleaned and organized data set is
waiting for you to download it! More commonly data needs to be
retrieved from a web service or web page and assembled into a usable
data set. This workshop will show you how to do that, using the httr
and rvest packages in R.

Prerequisites and Preparation
-----------------------------

Prior to the workshop you should:

- install R from <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
- install the tidyverse package in R with `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- download and extract the workshop materials from 
  <https://github.com/izahn/R_retrieving_data/archive/retrieving_data_v1.zip>

During the workshop you must have a laptop with the above software installed and a working internet connection.

The lesson notes are included in the download link above. You can also
view the lesson notes at
<https://rawgit.com/izahn/R_retrieving_data/master/retrievingOnlineData.html>

A github repository containing the workshop materials is
available <https://github.com/izahn/R_retrieving_data>.

This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with
basic knowledge of R. If you need a refresher we recommend the
[Software Carpentry Introductory R material](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/).
